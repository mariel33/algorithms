1. A real-life scenario of a linear search would be looking for a specific salad dressing at the grocery store.
They are not in alphabetical order so you search each bottle one by one looking for the right one.

2. A real-life scenario of a binary search would be searching for a book at the library.
They are all in alphabetical order so we look at the number of racks, find the middle rack and 
determine if we need to omit the first half of the racks or the second and repeat this process until we find our book.

3. It would take 7 iterations to find the value G using linear search.

4. It would take 3 iterations to find the value G using binary search.

5. Since you cannot use a binary search on an unsorted list, you would need to use a linear search.
However, it would be much more efficient to sort the data and then use a binary search since it is so large and would take so long to search through each item.

6. A binary search would be the algorithm to use in a sorted collection of a million items. 
It will quickly discard half of the data that we don't need to search through.

Programming Assignment:

1. function dictionarySearch(arr, targetWord) {
    var first = arr[0];
    var last = arr.length - 1;

    while (first <= last) {
        var mid = (first + last) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] > targetWord) {
            last = mid - 1;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] < targetWord) {
            first = mid + 1;
        }
        else {
            return mid;
        }
    }

    return "word not found";
}

2. 
function findFish(fishArray, targetFish) {
    for(var i = 0; i < fishArray.length; i++) {
        if (fishArray[i] === targetFish) {
            return "I've got the fish";
        }
    }
    return "the fish got away";
}
